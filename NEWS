The Lambert W root finding method was numerically unstable, for
example the roots of the cost function -628*x+log(x)-776.140660 could
not be computed correctly since exp(-776) is exactly zero using
doubles. Instead I implemented a bound-constrained Newton root finding
method which seems to be more stable.

First working C++ solver for Segment Neighborhood problem with Poisson
Loss and PeakSeg constraint (PeakSegPDPA function).
