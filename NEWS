Major updates to the package:

1. Updated constrained and unconstrained models for better numerical stability over long periods of no neural activity 

2. Added proceedure detect_spikes to compute the solution path across a range of tuning parameters lambda

3. Require LZeroSpikeInference as dependency 

4. Remove cross validation utility
