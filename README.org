An R package for computing constrained optimal segmentation models

** Installation

#+BEGIN_SRC R
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("tdhock/coseg")
#+END_SRC

** Usage

Linear time exact C++ solver for the optimal change points using the
Poisson loss and the PeakSeg constraint. There are two R functions:
- PeakSegPDPA is a direct interface to the C++ code. Returns matrices
  for the optimal cost and number of intervals stored by the algorithm
  at each step.
- PeakSegPDPAchrom is a more user-friendly interface, which takes a
  data.frame with columns chrom, chromStart, chromEnd as input, and
  returns data.frames as output.
